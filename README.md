# setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdmill/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```

if you're using linux you can run the init script to install curl, the rust toolchain,
and nushell. Once those are installed the init script calls `install.nu` to finish the
setup.

```bash
./init.sh
```
